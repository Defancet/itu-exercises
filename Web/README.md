The goal is to create a dynamic web page capable of retrieving and sending data to a server without needing to
reload the page. It is designed to be a chat application that fetches and displays the latest messages in real-time and
allows users to post new messages using AJAX.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading:** Fetches and displays messages from a server in JSON format without page refresh.
- **Real-time Updates:** New messages appear immediately after being sent and at regular intervals.
- **Message History:** Maintains a complete history of messages since the page was loaded.
- **Interactive Chat Window:** Messages can be posted directly through a user-friendly interface.

## Exercise Goals

- **Display Messages:** Fetch and display messages from the server directly into the chat window.
- **Format Messages:** Properly format the fetched messages for readability.
- **Message Input:** Allow users to input and send new messages.
- **Message Refresh:** Implement functionality to refresh messages in the chat window automatically without full page
  reloads.
- **Efficient Updates:** Efficiently add new messages without redrawing the entire chat window.

## Requirements

- HTML for the structure.
- JavaScript for handling client-side logic.
- CSS for basic styling.
