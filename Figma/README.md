The aim is to create a prototype for a "Flashcards" app using Figma consisting of four screens: a main page, a game page
with two modes (hide and show), and a summary page.

## Objectives

- Main page
- Game page with two modes: hide and show 
- Summary page
  Additional screens are optional and can be considered if time permits.
